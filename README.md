# News Aggregator

An aggregator to curate news articles from 3 different sources and enjoy a simplified access to latest news and headlines

## Performance Optimisations & UI/UX:

1. Implemented infinite scroll
   - Used paginated APIs
   - Tracks current page, loading state, last page reached state of each source
   - Programmatically detect when the page scroll is almost about to end, using Intersection Observer
2. Lazy loading of Images
   - Used Intersection Observer to detect, when a news article is about to enter the viewport and then initiate image load.
   - All news articles use single instance of Intersection Observer
   - Hence, it reduced the heaviness in page load time and the number of initial network requests
3. Implemented debounce for Search. So, there is a fine balance between faster results and the number of network calls.
4. Additional improvement to images
   - Handled image download error and image URL not available cases, by providing a fallback
   - Each news article could have different aspect ratio. Handled it, by having a cropped blurry image in the background and overlayed an uncropped image on top. So, users don't loose any area of the image. Provides a clean UI with all news articles having the same aspect ratio
   - Even though there are two instances of same image in UI. But, only one network call is needed to get the image
5. Desktop and Mobile friendly design
   - The page is completely responsive
   - Suports both portrait and landcape roatation of mobiles and tablets
   - Used relative css units which adapt to different screen sizes and pixel density
   - Used media queries where different behavior was needed for Desktop and Mobile devices
6. Themes and Dark mode can be easily added
   - Used Material UI design system which supports theming and dark mode switches
   - Very minimal instances of colors directed specified in CSS
